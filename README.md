Overview

This project focuses on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), employing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Transform for energy disaggregation analysis of household power consumption data.
Key Concepts

- FFT and Wavelet Transform: Used for signal analysis and pattern identification in energy usage.
- Energy Disaggregation: Extracts appliance-specific consumption from aggregate data, aiding in energy conservation efforts.

Methodology

- Data from the household power consumption dataset was analyzed to identify usage patterns of different appliances.
- Techniques like FFT were applied to separate and understand individual energy consumption components within the dataset.

Data Source
The analysis uses the "Household Power Consumption" dataset. Details and access to this dataset can be found in the report and are given below. It isn't uploaded as the file size is too large.
